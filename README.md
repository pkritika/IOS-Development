App Brainstorming
Apps that I like:
i) Instagram
IG Shoppping: Instagram has integrated shopping features that allow businesses to tag products in posts and stories, 
making it easier for users to discover and purchase items.
Privacy settings: Allowing users to modify their account by making it private or public is another feature that I like the most about this app.

ii) UberEats
Wide range of selection: Wide selection of restaurants that is near to my area .The feature of this app that lets us browse through menus, see reviews, 
and check ratings for each restaurant is one of the best thing about the app. 
Real-time Tracking: After placing an order, users can track the status of their delivery in real-time. Another feature that I like the most of this app. 

iii) Spotify
Music Streaming: It allows users to stream music from a massive collection of songs from various artists and genres which gives varieties to the user. 
Personalized Recommendations: The algorithms and user data to provide personalized music recommendations based on a user's listening history, preferences, and behaviors is the
another reason I like spotify the most for listening music.
